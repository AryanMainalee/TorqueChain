      <p>Managing monthly EMIs can feel overwhelming, especially with rising living costs in Nepal. Luckily, there are smart ways to reduce your EMI burden and manage your finances better. Here's how:</p>

      <h2>1. Make a Bigger Down Payment</h2>
      <p>Paying more upfront significantly reduces your loan principal. This results in lower EMI amounts and interest paid over time.</p>

      <h2>2. Choose a Longer Repayment Tenure</h2>
      <p>Stretching your repayment period spreads your loan across more months, lowering the EMI. But be mindfulâ€”longer tenures increase total interest paid.</p>

      <h2>3. Compare Loan Offers</h2>
      <p>Interest rates vary between banks like Nabil Bank, NIC Asia, and Prabhu Bank. Use online tools or visit local branches to compare offers before applying.</p>

      <h2>4. Negotiate Interest Rate</h2>
      <p>If you have a stable income and good credit history, request a lower interest rate or better loan terms from your lender.</p>

      <h2>5. Prepay Whenever You Can</h2>
      <p>When you receive bonuses or extra income, consider making lump-sum payments to reduce your outstanding loan and future EMIs.</p>

      <h2>6. Avoid Late Payments</h2>
      <p>Late EMIs harm your credit score and can lead to penalties. Set automatic payments or reminders to stay on track.</p>

      <h2>7. Refinance or Balance Transfer</h2>
      <p>If a bank offers better rates, you can transfer your loan. Many Nepali financial institutions provide this facility with low switching costs.</p>
